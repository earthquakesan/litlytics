With groundbreaking privacy protections, it gives you peace of mind that no one else can access your data — not even Apple.\n\n- [Boost your productivity](#productivity-gallery-item-1)\n- [Express yourself visually](#expression-gallery-item-2)\n- [A new era for Siri](#siri-gallery-item-3)\n\nApple Intelligence is designed to **protect your privacy at every step**. It’s integrated into the core of iPhone through on-device processing. So it’s aware of your personal information without collecting your personal information.\n\nAnd with **groundbreaking Private Cloud Compute**, Apple Intelligence can draw on larger Apple-designed server-based models, running on Apple silicon, to handle more complex requests for you while protecting your privacy.\n\n## Take total Camera Control.\n\n### Touch. Zoom. Click. Quick.\n\nNow you can take the perfect photo or video in record time. Camera Control gives you **an easier way to quickly access camera tools**. Simply slide your finger to adjust camera functions like exposure or depth of field, and toggle through each lens or use digital zoom to frame your shot — just how you like it.\n\n## New camera system.\n\n### Go to great lengths to get the perfect shot.\n\nThe **versatile new iPhone 16 camera system** captures beautiful photos — from up close or far away. The two-in-one 48MP Fusion camera lets you take stunning super-high-resolution images, or zoom in with the 2x optical-quality Telephoto. The Ultra Wide camera shoots extreme close-up macro photos or wider, more expansive pictures. Altogether, it’s like having **four lenses in your pocket**. And with spatial capture, you can even take photos and videos in 3D, which you can watch with Apple Vision Pro.\n\n![Raised dual camera system on iPhone 16 in Pink](https://www.apple.com/v/iphone-16/a/images/overview/camera-system/hero/hero_camera__bsixees3ujte_xlarge.jpg)\n\nThe new Ultra Wide camera with autofocus takes incredibly **sharp, detailed macro photos and videos**. You can also **frame more expansive scenes** without taking a step back. And because it has a larger aperture and bigger pixels, it can capture up to **2.6x more light** for higher image quality — even in low light.\n\nFor compelling close-ups with exceptional detail.\n\nCapture 4x more of a scene with the Ultra Wide camera.\n\nTake spectacular high-resolution photos with the 48MP Fusion camera.\n\nZoom in on your subject with the 2x Telephoto, enabled by the 48MP Fusion camera.\n\n![The Spatial camera feature demonstrated on an iPhone 16 in White](https://www.apple.com/v/iphone-16/a/images/overview/camera-system/spatial/hero_spatial__gna2d6arpimq_large.png)\n\nWith its realigned cameras, iPhone 16 lets you take **magical photos and videos in a whole new way** using spatial capture.

Simply select the mix and adjust intensity to get the sound you want after video capture.\n\nIn-frame\n\nOnly captures the voices of the people on camera, even if people off-camera are talking during the recording.\n\nStudio\n\nMakes voices sound like you’re recording in a professional studio equipped with sound-dampening walls. Great for vloggers or podcasters because the recording will sound like the mic is close to the subject’s mouth, even if it’s a few feet away.\n\nCinematic\n\nCaptures all of the voices around you and consolidates them toward the front of the screen — just like sound is formatted for the movies.\n\nChoose your  \nPhotographic Style.\n\n---\n\n### Change it up.\n\nChange it back.\n\n![Four Photographic Styles options shown on an iPhone 16 in Pink](https://www.apple.com/v/iphone-16/a/images/overview/photographic-styles/tone__eowv4kd87csy_large.png)\n\n#### Lock in your look.\n\nWe’ve created new styles that let you **dial in your exact desired look with more advanced skin-tone rendering** and set it across your photos.
