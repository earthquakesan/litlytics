In preparation for the DLC, they nerfed fire damage into the ground so it can't kill armored enemies or crowds (the 2 things it was good at vs a regular MG).\n\nI haaaaaate this balance philosophy. If you want to shake up the meta, give players new options. Don't find the one thing people are already having fun with, take it away, and task them with finding a new way to have fun. This is like the 4th time they've done this since I bought the game, and I'm beginning to think my new way of having fun this time should be uninstalling this game and playing something else.\n\n\"It feels like every time someone finds something fun, the fun is removed\" -Johan Pilestedt, CCO of Arrowhead",

      "content": "I want to enjoy this more, but I don't really like how onerous just the act of getting ready to play this game feels.\n\nAlmost all of my public random quickplay matches involved sweaty people getting ass mad for whatever reason, killing everyone and leaving the samples behind. Can't even report them if they preemptively block you either. Great fun!!! So I just don't feel like jumping in without a premade group of friends which has its own scheduling problems.\n\nI don't know what loadout to run other than just being the autocannon mule. Everything I've unlocked is either not very effective the vast majority of the time, or is just gross meta shotgun requirements. I've never even piloted one of the mechs because it just feels like a wasteful liability more than a fun tool. maybe it's a product of playing on 7s almost exclusively once I got the autocannon unlocked. I don't really know.\n\nSometimes the map generation just hands you a completely unwinnable generation (Three eye towers clustered around a jammer on a raid map? Cool. That's really Fun and Balanced.) Other times it just feels like a 45m jogging simulator because ammo economy is so poor that you're better off sneaking than dealing with endless reinforcement waves. Fire damage instantly killing you is super duper fun as well. What's the point of completely sealed armor anyway.\n\nT'was really fun when folks were around to play it until the slog of the same feeling maps and conditions stopped being fun to deal with. Totally fun to only be able to fight in dense fog for each bot map. Or dealing with earthquakes that instantly sap all stamina for some reason when fighting bugs.\n\nIt's a good solid game otherwise. Movement feels good, if limiting when compared to say, Darktide. Gunplay is solid when you actually get to use something other than a special weapon. But even then the trash mobs soak up so much regular ammo and the specials just ignore regular primary ammo\n\nAll in all, \"eh\". Sony's blockade of countries pretty much ended any further support I was inclined to give as well.",

          "content": "The PS5 arrived fairly quickly and was in good shape upon arrival.\n\nNow, regarding the console itself. The PS5 has a 'unique' design and is easily the biggest video game console I've ever seen. Due to its sheer size, I've had to place it horizontally within my media center where it's a bit difficult to access the disc drive.\n\nThe console came with a short HDMI 2.1 cable (capable of supporting 120fps if both your TV and the game you're playing support it too) and a generously sized USB cable for plugging in the controller or charging it. The game \"Astro's Playroom\" comes preinstalled and is an enjoyable, albeit short, game which you can use to familiarize yourself with the controller and console.\n\nThe console is advertised as having 825GB of storage, but only 667GB are usable so I'd recommend buying either an external HDD or a compatible nvme SSD for extra storage. PS5 games load extraordinarily fast and PS4 games enjoy faster loading times as well. Even XCOM2, which barely chugged along the PS4, runs smooth as butter. That said, install times are still rather long and it takes a while to transfer games to/from my HDD and SSD.\n\nDespite claiming 8k on the box, I'm not aware of any games that are capable of natively supporting it. While the console does support 4k resolution and 120fps, you'll need to find games that do so too. While some games will run at 4k/60fps, others will have resolution vs. performance modes that'll sacrifice either resolution or framerate to ensure the game runs well.\n\nThe DualSense controller is appealing to the eye, has an ergonomic design, and the built-in haptic feedback is very pleasing to experience whenever a game supports it. My only complaint is that the battery life is somewhat poor and seems to charge slowly whenever plugged into something that's not a PS5. As such, I'd recommend charging the controller while playing a game or while the PS5 is in rest mode.\n\nThe PS5's Wi-Fi adapter is an improvement over the PS4's. It supports both 2.4ghz and 5ghz. I've noticed my downloads running faster on the PS5 than the PS4 while on the same network.\n\nThe PS5's backwards compatibility with PS4 games seems to work pretty well. Most games (especially ones with PS4 Pro patches) run extremely well and you can play them with a PS4 controller if you'd like. The only downside is that installing PS4 games seems to add to the PS5's \"other\" storage space. All games now have an install progress bar, and you can now separately delete DLC from games.\n\nAs far as problems go, I've found that the PS5's UI leaves something to be desired and I've occasionally run into small software problems, usually whenever installing, moving, or deleting games. Additionally, when I plugged in my external HDD for the first time, half of its game library was seemingly deleted. I now suspect that it's due to most of the games not being fully installed, something that I've now remedied on the PS5 and have not experienced again.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase so far and find it to be a worthwhile upgrade to my aging PS4. If you own physical PS4 games or prefer physical game copies in general, buy the PS5 disc edition. If you go all digital, get the cheaper digital edition. Aside from the presence (or lack thereof) of an optical drive, I'm not aware of any difference between them.",

They mention the aesthetic appeal and ergonomic design of the console and controller, as well as improvements like the faster Wi-Fi adapter. \n\nWhile the reviewer notes some drawbacks, including concerns about the console's size, storage availability, battery life of the controller, UI issues, and initial problems with game installations, these criticisms do not overshadow their overall satisfaction with the product. The review concludes with a recommendation for potential buyers and indicates a positive sentiment toward the PS5 as a worthwhile investment. \n\nIn summary, despite acknowledging some flaws, the reviewer's contentment with the overall performance and features of the PS5 reflects a predominantly positive sentiment.",

This means that developer can shut down the game at any time and you never truly own anything. It also means that if developer's servers are down, you can't play even the single player portion of the game you have just paid for.\n- EA Games require you agreeing to give away ALL your privacy and let EA monitor everything you do on the PS5. If you decline this, you can no longer play the games you bought and thought you were owning. I chose to decline this.\n- Ubisoft Games require you creating an account, even for playing demos! This is so ridiculous that we decided not to play any Ubisoft games. Again, once you create an account with them, they can track anything you do on the PS5. Would not be surprised if they require a credit card too.\n- Other PS5 games have only the first chapter of the game on the disk, then require huge downloads to actually continue the game past the first chapter. This impacts the resale values of the games and also means developer can take that functionality away anytime they want to.\n- Yes, graphics are better, but games that truly take advantage of what the PS5 can do are still very few.\n- Deleting games or demos from the menu is not possible, which is another ridiculous change. You have to go under your account and through multiple menus for this simple function.\n- Compared to PS3 where we owned 100+ games, we have around 5 games on the PS5 and most of these are PS4 games that don't require an internet connection. The PS5 has been a waste of money. Wish we would have known the scam being run with regard to owning the games.\n\nOverall, this console is junk and I wish we would have kept our PS3 and the games we owned for it.

How is it that Sony thought voice chat should come through the controller? There is no setting that will allow voice chat to come through the TV. The only options are to have it come through the controller (which sounds like broken static and is too quiet to hear voices) or through a headset. Some peeps r probably fine with this bc they use a headset. But for those of us with different audio settings, Sony screwed up! The PS4 had more flexibility for voice chat.\n\n2. Why is it so difficult to turn off the PS5? On the PS4, it was super fast to turn off the system from the controller. On PS5, you have to push the middle button, scroll along the small symbols at the bottom of the screen to the very last one, then hit it, then select to power off. Way too many steps!\n\n3. Why isn’t there a simple way to access messages? If you’re accustomed to texting with peeps directly from your console, you’re gonna hate this new design! To message a friend, you gotta hit the middle PS button, scroll along the small symbols at the bottom, click on the “base”, then scroll down to messages, search your friend, then type. What the heck!! The PS4 made accessing messages so easy. If u use the app, this may not matter much. But if u type on console, this is so not cool.\n\n4.

All games now have an install progress bar, and you can now separately delete DLC from games.\n\nAs far as problems go, I've found that the PS5's UI leaves something to be desired and I've occasionally run into small software problems, usually whenever installing, moving, or deleting games. Additionally, when I plugged in my external HDD for the first time, half of its game library was seemingly deleted. I now suspect that it's due to most of the games not being fully installed, something that I've now remedied on the PS5 and have not experienced again.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase so far and find it to be a worthwhile upgrade to my aging PS4. If you own physical PS4 games or prefer physical game copies in general, buy the PS5 disc edition. If you go all digital, get the cheaper digital edition. Aside from the presence (or lack thereof) of an optical drive, I'm not aware of any difference between them.",

They mention the aesthetic appeal and ergonomic design of the console and controller, as well as improvements like the faster Wi-Fi adapter. \n\nWhile the reviewer notes some drawbacks, including concerns about the console's size, storage availability, battery life of the controller, UI issues, and initial problems with game installations, these criticisms do not overshadow their overall satisfaction with the product. The review concludes with a recommendation for potential buyers and indicates a positive sentiment toward the PS5 as a worthwhile investment. \n\nIn summary, despite acknowledging some flaws, the reviewer's contentment with the overall performance and features of the PS5 reflects a predominantly positive sentiment.",

This means that developer can shut down the game at any time and you never truly own anything. It also means that if developer's servers are down, you can't play even the single player portion of the game you have just paid for.\n- EA Games require you agreeing to give away ALL your privacy and let EA monitor everything you do on the PS5. If you decline this, you can no longer play the games you bought and thought you were owning. I chose to decline this.\n- Ubisoft Games require you creating an account, even for playing demos! This is so ridiculous that we decided not to play any Ubisoft games. Again, once you create an account with them, they can track anything you do on the PS5. Would not be surprised if they require a credit card too.\n- Other PS5 games have only the first chapter of the game on the disk, then require huge downloads to actually continue the game past the first chapter. This impacts the resale values of the games and also means developer can take that functionality away anytime they want to.\n- Yes, graphics are better, but games that truly take advantage of what the PS5 can do are still very few.\n- Deleting games or demos from the menu is not possible, which is another ridiculous change. You have to go under your account and through multiple menus for this simple function.\n- Compared to PS3 where we owned 100+ games, we have around 5 games on the PS5 and most of these are PS4 games that don't require an internet connection. The PS5 has been a waste of money. Wish we would have known the scam being run with regard to owning the games.\n\nOverall, this console is junk and I wish we would have kept our PS3 and the games we owned for it. These PS3 games had more fun gameplay and you truly owned the games you bought. We will not buy any further consoles from Sony.",

How is it that Sony thought voice chat should come through the controller? There is no setting that will allow voice chat to come through the TV. The only options are to have it come through the controller (which sounds like broken static and is too quiet to hear voices) or through a headset. Some peeps r probably fine with this bc they use a headset. But for those of us with different audio settings, Sony screwed up! The PS4 had more flexibility for voice chat.\n\n2. Why is it so difficult to turn off the PS5? On the PS4, it was super fast to turn off the system from the controller. On PS5, you have to push the middle button, scroll along the small symbols at the bottom of the screen to the very last one, then hit it, then select to power off. Way too many steps!\n\n3. Why isn’t there a simple way to access messages? If you’re accustomed to texting with peeps directly from your console, you’re gonna hate this new design! To message a friend, you gotta hit the middle PS button, scroll along the small symbols at the bottom, click on the “base”, then scroll down to messages, search your friend, then type. What the heck!! The PS4 made accessing messages so easy. If u use the app, this may not matter much. But if u type on console, this is so not cool.\n\n4. My first Ps5 got stolen (no, I hadn’t been irresponsible)…maybe there should be a GPS chip in these to detour people from stealing them.\n\nI still recommend it due to how much faster it operates than the PS4, but come on Sony, fix this crap!
